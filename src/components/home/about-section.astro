    Hi, I'm <strong>Venkata Sai Chaitanya Tatikonda</strong>.<br /><br />
    I'm currently in my final semester of a Master's in Information Technology at
    Florida State University, maintaining a 4.0 GPA.<br /><br />
    I specialize in front-end development, focusing on clean, responsive, and user-friendly
    interfaces that ensure a seamless user experience.<br /><br />
    I also bring hands-on experience in back-end development and Generative AI, and
    I'm actively building full-stack solutions that are both smart and scalable.<br
    /><br />
    Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, it's something I genuinely love and find
    creatively fulfilling.
